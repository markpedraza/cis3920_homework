# CIS 3920 - Data Mining for Business Analytics [Fall 2024] - Homework Assignments
This repo contains all the homework assignments I completed for my CIS 3920 course at CUNY Baruch. This class taught a verticle slice on the world of machine learning, showing many different algorithms that can be used for predicting categorical outcomes (classification models). Below is what each assignment is focused on.

### Homework #1
- Data manipulation and preparation for model training.

### Homework #2
- Logistic regression.

### Homework #3
- k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

### Homework #4 
- Random Forest.

### Homework #5
- MultiModel. Compare model results between KNN, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Random Forest while using the same dataset.
